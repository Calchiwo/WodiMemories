WodiMemories

**Part of the BuiltByWodi® Projects Family** | A Visual Journey of Caleb "Calchiwo" Wodi through moments, milestones, and memories.

**WodiMemories** is a story-driven photo gallery that captures the essence of my life’s journey — from humble beginnings to meaningful milestones. Built with simplicity, emotion, and elegance, it’s designed to be more than just a collection of images. Every picture tells a story, and every story is a piece of the bigger picture that is me.

This project is a feature of [WodiWideWeb](https://github.com/Calchiwo/WodiWideWeb), but it lives as its own independent site and GitHub repository for flexibility, scalability, and creative freedom.
